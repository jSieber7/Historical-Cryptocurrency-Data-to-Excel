# Historical-Cryptocurrency-Data-to-Excel

This program gets historical cryptocurrency data off the internet and exports it into an excel friendly format. 

Through the functions in the python file, one can easily input what coins to gather information about and the date to receive this information.

Uses Beautiful Soup and Pandas libraries. Through Pandas a user can easily export the scraped data into many different file formats. This program is particulary useful for keeping track of a cyrpto portfolio when used in conjunction with Pandas. An example of using the python file in this way is provided in the branch of the project.
